A decentralized ephemeral file sharing TUI browser 📁 🔄 🔒

## Overview

I had started building around the Christmas holidays, when [Junakoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkanoo) is observed. In a sense it's a practice that helps us to share our secrets as a culture in a non-obvious way.

Junkanoo enables secure, peer-to-peer file sharing through an encrypted channel. It provides a command-line interface for browsing and transferring files between connected nodes.

## Features

- 🔒 Encrypted file transfers using libp2p
- 📁 File browsing and selection interface
- 🚀 Fast file transfers with chunked streaming
- 🔄 Real-time progress tracking
- 🎯 Simple peer-to-peer connection model

## Installation

### Using Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap maschad/junkanoo
brew install junkanoo
```

### Using Cargo (Rust)

```bash
cargo install junkanoo
```

### Using AUR (Arch Linux)

```bash
yay -S junkanoo
# or
